# First Week

## Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
Honestly, I had no idea what to expect. I've been pleased by the structure and flow of the work so far. I have learned a lot of things I did not know before. I expected to learn a lot; I just wasn't sure exactly how it was going to happen!

## What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
I'm very eager to learn Python and Django. I know it's a very marketable skillset to have and it opens up a lot of fun opportunities!

## What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
Here's a quick list of some interesting things about me:

- I have a 1-year-old daughter named Blake.
- I've been married to my wife Blair for 2 years <img src="./assets/My_Wife_And_Daughter.jpg" height="230px" style="display: block">

- I have the unofficial record for the fastest person to eat a 3 way at Skyline Chili (44 seconds) ðŸ’ª
- I was a cheerleader in highschool and coached cheerleading afterwards. <video src="./assets/Flips.MOV" height="230px" style="display: block" controls muted>

## Cool Code Snippet

```javascript
function highFive(nathanDidAGoodJobOnHisBlog) {
    if (nathanDidAGoodJobOnHisBlog) {
        return "High Five!";
    } else {
        return "*Nathan Cries*";
    }
}

// console.log(highFive(true)) || console.log(highFive(false))
```


# Second Week

## What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?
Thereâ€™s a lot I wish I could do but, when it comes to specifically HTML and CSS, I wish I knew more about what was going on under the hood so that when I run into weird errors or problems, I could better troubleshoot them.

## What are you struggling with?
Iâ€™m currently not struggling too bad, but I have run into the problem of getting ahead of myself and trying to learn/comprehend things that are too far beyond my skill set, and it stresses me out.

# How do you solve a problem?
I solve a problem by thinking it through simply, and writing down the large ideas of what I want to accomplish and then I tackle that step-by-step. I always try to get context before I hyperfocus on the first solution that comes to my head.

# What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?
I tried to move on to something else and then come back to it. Also getting more context and doing more research, isolate the problem as well and take away as many factors as possible.
