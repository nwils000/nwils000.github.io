## Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
Honestly, I had no idea what to expect. I've been pleased by the structure and flow of the work so far. I have learned a lot of things I did not know before. I expected to learn a lot; I just wasn't sure exactly how it was going to happen!

## What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
I'm very eager to learn Python and Django. I know it's a very marketable skillset to have and it opens up a lot of fun opportunities!

## What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
Here's a quick list of some interesting things about me:

- I have a 1-year-old daughter named Blake.
- I've been married to my wife Blair for 2 years.
