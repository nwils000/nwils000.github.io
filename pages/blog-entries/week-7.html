        <h1>Tired of Vanilla!</h1>
        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <p>
          This week with JavaScript has been a rollercoaster! I'm starting to
          feel the burnout from using plain vanilla JavaScript, but there's
          light at the end of the tunnel because we're jumping into React next
          week, which I absolutely love! The biggest takeaway for me this week
          is that almost everything in JavaScript is an object... functions,
          arrays, etc. This realization has shifted how I understand and follow
          JavaScript code, making unfamiliar features more approachable. I love
          JavaScript, but manual DOM manipulation isn't my favorite, which is
          why I'm so excited to start working with React!
        </p>
        <h2>The Job Search</h2>
        <p>
          Everyone keeps telling me that finding a job won't be a problem, but I
          can't help feeling skeptical. Is it just my insecurities? Despite
          these doubts, I'm pushing myself to network more actively, especially
          on LinkedIn. Just last week, I had lunch with the CEO of a local tech
          company. They aren't hiring junior developers right now, but things
          might change by the time I finish my bootcamp. We had a conversation,
          and he wanted to keep in touch. No promises, but it's given me a huge
          boost and the motivation to give my all to this bootcamp and my job
          search. Even though I'm naturally pessimistic, the experiences I'm
          gaining are slowly but surely helping me shed that negativity.
