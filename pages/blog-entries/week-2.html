          What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the
          coding skills to accomplish?
        </h2>
        <p>
          There’s a lot I wish I could do but, when it comes to specifically
          HTML and CSS, I wish I knew more about what was going on under the
          hood so that when I run into weird errors or problems, I could better
          troubleshoot them.
        </p>
        <h2>What are you struggling with?</h2>
        <p>
          I’m currently not struggling too bad, but I have run into the problem
          of getting ahead of myself and trying to learn/comprehend things that
          are too far beyond my skill set, and it stresses me out.
        </p>
        <h2>How do you solve a problem?</h2>
        <p>
          I solve a problem by thinking it through simply, and writing down the
          large ideas of what I want to accomplish and then I tackle that
          step-by-step. I always try to get context before I hyperfocus on the
          first solution that comes to my head.
        </p>
        <h2>What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?</h2>
        <p>
          I tried to move on to something else and then come back to it. Also
          getting more context and doing more research, isolate the problem as
          well and take away as many factors as possible.
