        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <h2>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</h2>
        <p>
          Honestly, I had no idea what to expect. I've been pleased by the
          structure and flow of the work so far. I have learned a lot of things
          I did not know before. I expected to learn a lot; I just wasn't sure
          exactly how it was going to happen!
        </p>
        <h2>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h2>
        <p>
          I'm very eager to learn Python and Django. I know it's a very
          marketable skillset to have and it opens up a lot of fun
          opportunities!
        </p>
        <h2>
          What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this
          blog?
        </h2>
        <p>Here's a quick list of some interesting things about me:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I have a 1-year-old daughter named Blake.</li>
          <li>I've been married to my wife Blair for 2 years</li>
          <li>
            I have the unofficial record for the fastest person to eat a 3 way
            at Skyline Chili (44 seconds) ðŸ’ª
          </li>
          <li>
            I was a cheerleader in highschool and coached cheerleading
            afterwards.
          </li>
        </ul>
