        <h1>I'm a Programmer</h1>
        <p>
          This week, I truly feel as though I've crossed some very important
          barriers in my understanding. Now, I think I'm finally confident
          enough to call myself a programmer.
        </p>
        <h2>What things do I feel confident doing?</h2>
        <p>
          I'm beginning to see JavaScript not just as code, but as clear and
          understandable English. Objects, arrays, functions, methods,
          parameters, loops, statements, expressionsâ€”all of it now makes perfect
          sense to me.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What did I learn that helped me understand the development process?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Learning how to effectively use functions to create DRY (Don't Repeat
          Yourself) code taught me how to streamline vanilla JavaScript
          development. Also, using APIs and Node packages showed me that it's
          okay to integrate other people's code into my projects.
        </p>
        <h2>What does it mean to develop good code?</h2>
        <p>
          Developing good code means three key things: #1 it has to work, #2 it
          has to be DRY, #3 it has to be easily readable.
        </p>
        <h2>What does it mean to be a good developer?</h2>
        <p>
          A good developer can code quickly, knows where to look and how to
          solve problems, and can debug effectively. Most importantly, a good
          developer delivers quality code that not only works but can also be
          updated and read by anyone.
        </p>
        <h2>What is one thing that programmers hate doing?</h2>
        <p>Programmers hate typing.</p>
        <h2>What am I excited to learn moving forward?</h2>
        <p>
          Object-oriented programming has really clicked for me. I'm eager to
          push my skills further, focusing on creating super DRY code that is
          efficiently organized.
