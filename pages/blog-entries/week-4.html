        <h1>A New Chapter</h1>
        <p>
          Reflecting on my onboarding experience, I contemplate what was helpful
          while working remotely, what hindered my progress, and how I overcame
          those challenges.
        </p>
        <h2>What I Found Helpful Working Remotely</h2>
        <p>
          I found separating myself from distractions to be key when working
          remotely. It's especially important for me to give full attention to
          my projects. I managed this by working at the library or at night when
          it was quieter, allowing me to focus completely.
        </p>
        <h2>What Hindered My Progress</h2>
        <p>
          The biggest blocker during onboarding was not properly pseudo-coding.
          The eagerness to jump into coding meant I didn't spend enough time
          planning. This led to logic issues in my projects, like the alarm
          clock, which required extensive debugging that could have been avoided
          with more thorough pseudo-coding.
        </p>
        <h2>Overcoming Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          I overcame challenges by being very active on Slack, reaching out for
          help, and diving into resources about topics I was less familiar with.
          This proactive approach was crucial for navigating through the
          difficulties I faced.
