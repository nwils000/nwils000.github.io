        <h1>Buoyant</h1>
        <p>
          This week has been amazing. Each morning, I'm excited to go to class,
          absorbing an incredible amount of information faster than I ever have
          before. Once I'm home, I find myself having to consciously stop from
          spending the entire evening coding—I'm even dreaming in code! This
          past week has surpassed my expectations, I feel buoyant and full of
          optimism.

        <h2>What held me back this week?</h2>
        <p>
          Rushing into the coding phase was my main setback. I realized too late
          that dedicating more time to planning and pseudo-coding would have
          prevented the extensive refactoring and overanalysis that consumed
          two-thirds of my project time.
        </p>
        <h2>What I wish to learn?</h2>
        <p>
          I’m looking to deepen my understanding of JSON. It was overlooked in
          my recent project, yet it's very important for server communication
        </p>
        <h2>My motivation for web development?</h2>
        <p>
          I'm driven by a desire to create work that stands out, I want to blend
          creativity with innovation, all while being financially rewarded. It’s
          the thrill of seeing my skills directly translate into success that
          excites me.
