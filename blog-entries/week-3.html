        <h1>Web Fundamentals</h1>
        <h2>Roles of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are foundational to the web. Without HTML,
          there is no structure, which means there's nothing to style with CSS
          or manipulate with JavaScript. Without CSS, the web could still
          function, but it would lack style and creativity. Without JavaScript,
          the web would be static; it would lack complex functionalities like
          e-commerce, social media, instant messaging, and many other luxuries
          we take for granted.
        </p>
        <h2>Blog Incorporations</h2>
        <p>
          My blog currently lacks JavaScript, meaning I haven't defined any
          explicit objects. However, I do intend to incorporate JavaScript into
          the blog. Potential objects include the blog cards on the home screen
          that link to posts, a contact form, and comments on blog posts.
