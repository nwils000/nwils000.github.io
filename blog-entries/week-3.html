        What was helpful during onboarding working remotely? What hindered your
        progress during onboarding? How did you overcome challenges during
        onboarding?
        <h2>What I Found Helpful Working Remotely</h2>
        <p>
          I found separating myself from distractions to be key when working
          remotely. Especially while working on a project, it's important for me
          to give it my full attention. I achieved this by working at the
          library or at night when everyone else is asleep.
        </p>
        <h2>What Hindered My Progress</h2>
        <p>
          The biggest blocker to my progress during onboarding was not properly
          pseudo-coding. I get too anxious to start coding that I skip spending
          adequate time planning it out beforehand. This led to logic issues,
          especially with my alarm clock project, that took me hours of
          debugging which could have been avoided by proper pseudo-coding.
        </p>
        <h2>Overcoming Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          I overcame challenges by being very active on Slack, reaching out for
          help, and diving into resources on topics I wasn't familiar with.
